        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Nathan Louie. I am a Chinese 2nd-year Computer Engineering Major in Cal Poly SLO 
                and a former coding and programming student at CodeNation, a program which guides students into the world of coding. 
                I have experience in JavaScript, Java, and Python for programming; for hardware/software engineering, 
                I have experience in Verilog/SystemVerilog and RISC-V. I'm always looking to learn more and do the best I can. 
                I've been told I'm a quick learner, and am able to pick up new ideas fairly quickly. I try my best to keep an open mind 
                and absorb as much knowledge as I can, like a sponge.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as interests go, I have fond interests in the Super Smash Brothers series and its competitive scene, as well as martial arts! 
                I've been learning Chinese Kung Fu for 7+ years now, which has taught me a lot about myself as a person, and allowed me to improve 
                myself. I personally recommend trying it at least once, though it isn't for everyone.
            </p>
