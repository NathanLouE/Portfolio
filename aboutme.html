            <p>
            Hi! My name is Nathan Louie. I am a 17 year old student in 12th grade of Balboa High School 
            and a coding and programming student at CodeNation, a program which guides students into the world of coding.
            I am in their Advanced Course, and I am learning three coding languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I have fond interests in the Super Smash Brothers series and its competitive scene, as well as anime such as My Hero Academia and other games like Pok√©mon and Mario games!
            </p>
