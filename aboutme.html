        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Nathan Louie. I am a 16 year old student, moving to 12th grade at Balboa High School, and a coding student at CodeNation, a program which guides students into the world of coding. I am in their Advanced Course, and I am learning three coding languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
            </p>
            <p>I also have a fond interest in the Super Smash Brothers series and its competitive scene, as well as anime such as My Hero Academia.
